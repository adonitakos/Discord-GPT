# <b> Discord GPT </b>
This is a Discord bot that will use the OpenAI API, to be
able to query and recieve very useful information like you 
would in ChatGPT, except within merely your Discord chats. <br>

You can invite it to your server using the following link:<br>
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1050671337049423932&permissions=517544057920&scope=bot

## Example Demo

Unlike ChatGPT, it does not type out the answer, rather this will simply provide it in 'one shot'
